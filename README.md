# Arush Sharma | Product Manager
(built upwards from a truly bare bones Jekyll starter theme by [Garett Boatman](https://garrettboatman.com/))


Hello,

I'm a Product Manager from Mumbai. As a former Web Engineer turned Product Manager, I understand what it means to build products that are high-quality, cohesive, and scalable. I have built awareness for the small details, which is helpful for working through requirements, visualizations, models, and prototypes with cross-functional team members.
