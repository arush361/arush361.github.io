  <h1>Building products<br>that matter.</h1>
  <p class="hero__bio">I'm Arush, a <span class="hl">Senior Product Manager</span> at <span class="hl">PointClickCare</span>, where I build identity platforms that decide which humans <em>and</em> which AI agents get to touch patient data. It's like being a bouncer &mdash; except the club is healthcare, the VIPs are large language models, and the dress code is HIPAA compliance.</p>
  <p class="hero__bio"><span class="hl">10+ years</span> shipping across gaming (<span class="hl">PokerStars, 72M+ users</span>), fintech, and SaaS. I take products from <span class="hl">0&rarr;1</span> and scale them to millions &mdash; armed with <span class="hl">LLMs</span>, <span class="hl">platform thinking</span>, an alarming amount of coffee, and an unreasonable belief that complexity is just clarity waiting to happen.</p>
