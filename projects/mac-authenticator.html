  <h2 class="project-section__title">Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>I was unlocking my phone 15 times a day just to copy 2FA codes. Authy has a desktop app, sure, but it syncs your secrets to their cloud &mdash; and once you work in identity security, that starts to feel uncomfortable. I wanted something that stays on my machine and doesn't phone home. So I built it.</p>
</div>

<div class="project-section reveal">
  <h2 class="project-section__title">Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>There's a gap between "phone authenticator" and "enterprise SSO." Desktop power users who care about privacy have basically no good options. Also &mdash; if you have to look at a 2FA app dozens of times a day, it might as well not look boring.</p>
</div>

<div class="project-section reveal">
  <h2 class="project-section__title">Solution</h2>
  <p><strong>Desktop Authenticator</strong> is a macOS Electron app that generates TOTP codes locally with encrypted storage and zero external data transmission:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li><strong>TOTP generation</strong> &mdash; standard RFC 6238 time-based codes, auto-refreshing every 30 seconds with a visual countdown</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple QR input methods</strong> &mdash; file upload, drag-and-drop, clipboard paste (&#8984;V), and screenshot capture for maximum flexibility</li>
    <li><strong>Encrypted local storage</strong> &mdash; secrets stored in a SQLite database with <code>electron-store</code> encryption. Nothing leaves the device</li>
    <li><strong>Minecraft-themed UI</strong> &mdash; pixelated VT323 font, block-style elements, dark mode support. Makes the mundane act of copying codes feel intentional</li>
    <li><strong>Native macOS integration</strong> &mdash; menu bar presence, keyboard shortcuts, system dark mode detection</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="excalidraw-diagram" data-project="mac-authenticator"></div>
  <p class="exp-entry__desc" style="margin-top:0.75rem">Fully air-gappable. No network calls, no telemetry, no cloud sync. Packaged as .dmg and .zip.</p>

<div class="project-section reveal">
  <h2 class="project-section__title">Key Product Decisions</h2>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li><strong>Desktop-first, not mobile</strong> &mdash; deliberately chose the underserved surface. Mobile authenticators are abundant; desktop ones that respect privacy are rare</li>
    <li><strong>Local-only by design</strong> &mdash; no sync feature, no account system. This isn't a limitation &mdash; it's the core value proposition. Users who want cloud sync already have Authy</li>
    <li><strong>Minecraft theme as differentiation</strong> &mdash; authenticator apps are commoditized. The theme creates emotional attachment to a utility tool &mdash; users remember and reach for it because it's <em>theirs</em></li>
    <li><strong>Multiple QR input paths</strong> &mdash; onboarding friction kills 2FA adoption. Supporting 4 input methods (file, drag, paste, screenshot) means users can always get their secrets into the app regardless of source format</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="project-section__title">Lessons Learned</h2>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li><strong>Security products succeed on trust, not features.</strong> The single most important "feature" is what the app <em>doesn't</em> do &mdash; it doesn't phone home, doesn't sync, doesn't require an account. Absence of risk is the product</li>
    <li><strong>Personality in utility software creates loyalty.</strong> The Minecraft theme sounds frivolous but it turns a forgettable tool into something users actively choose over alternatives. Delight matters even in security tools</li>
    <li><strong>Electron gets a bad rap, but for this use case it's ideal.</strong> The app needs to process images, read QR codes, and manage a database &mdash; all things Electron handles well. It doesn't need to be a 5MB native Swift app; it needs to work reliably</li>
  </ul>
